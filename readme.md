# Here are some beginner-friendly Rust projects you can build to practice and enhance your skills

1. **Command-Line Calculator**:

   - Create a simple command-line application that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

2. **To-Do List Application**:

   - Build a command-line to-do list manager where users can add, remove, and view tasks. You can also implement saving tasks to a file for persistence.

3. **Guess the Number Game**:

   - Develop a game where the program randomly selects a number within a range, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints for higher or lower guesses.

4. **Text-Based Adventure Game**:

   - Create a simple text-based adventure game where players can navigate through different rooms, collect items, and interact with characters.

5. **Web Scraper**:

   - Write a program that fetches data from a website and extracts specific information (like headlines from a news site). You can use libraries like `reqwest` and `scraper`.

6. **Basic HTTP Server**:

   - Implement a simple HTTP server that can respond to GET requests. This will help you understand how web servers work and how to handle requests and responses.

7. **File Organizer**:

   - Create a tool that organizes files in a directory based on their file types (e.g., moving images to an "Images" folder, documents to a "Documents" folder).

8. **Markdown to HTML Converter**:

   - Build a command-line tool that converts Markdown files into HTML. This will help you understand file I/O and string manipulation.

9. **Simple Chat Application**:

   - Develop a basic chat application using TCP sockets. This can be a console-based app where multiple users can send messages to each other.

10. **Personal Diary**:
    - Create a command-line diary application where users can write daily entries, view past entries, and search for specific entries.

These projects will help you get familiar with Rust's syntax, standard library, and common programming concepts while providing a fun and engaging way to learn.
